# YeastScrapper project
Scraps yeast data from the web using Python.
This project was born after I wanted to gather some informations about the yeasts I could by from an online shop.
The yeasts data is collected from the website directly using python https requests and the data is then parsed from the page.

Resulting data is written in the form of a json file that can be analysed afterwards.
It was a nice project, quick and dirty one but it worked !
The main issue being that this will work as long as the targeted website does not change its structure, or requesting policies are not disabled.
